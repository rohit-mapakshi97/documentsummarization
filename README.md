# documentsummarization
We aim to develop a text summarization application using natural language processing (NLP) techniques. The application will be trained on the WikiHow dataset, which is a large and diverse collection of articles and summaries. We plan to implement various NLP models such as GPT-2, T5, and TextRank for the text summarization task.
